# Django_FoodApp
A Django based web application. 
The site is based on food delivery services and uses Django version 3.1 to implement the backend while HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript are used for the frontend. 
Nothing too over the top, just a basic implementation of the Web Framework to demonstrate the exploitation of its features.
